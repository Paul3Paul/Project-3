            <h3>Honesty</h3>
            <p>It is difficult but not impossible to conduct strictly honest business. . . . 
              What is true is that honesty is incompatible with the amassing of a
               large fortune.</p>
            <h3>violence and Force</h3>
             <p>It is better to be violent, if there is violence in our hearts,
               than to put on the cloak of nonviolence to cover impotence.</p>
